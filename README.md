Personal Website V5.0 - After four previous iterations and over 6 years of tinkering, this is my current website. Created using Next.js with some additional bells and whistles (Chakra UI, Vercel hosting / analytics, Framer Motion).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
If you want to tinker with my website, feel free to follow these steps: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
