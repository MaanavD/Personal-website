## Sadness, mostly
There's not much to say for today, other than the allergies from my walk on the 12th were back - not good news at all. I had itchy hands and feet , but these only occurred to me after I returned from my climbing session, extremely unmotivated and fatigued.

\
Despite the amazing day I had yesterday, I felt as though I had fallen back into a slump, feeling week and itchy. I was liking the place but I was also truly frustrated at my situation - why was all of this happenning now, when it's never been an occurrence before? 

\
More good was to come (surely), but not quite yet.
