### Alcorc√≥n
After crashing for many hours, I woke up early and headed to the Lidl, a local grocery store. Here, I bought what I'd normally buy in groceries for 20 euros - it was insane.

I didn't do much else of note today, but it was fun to get into the grove of things with a grocery trip and some walking around to get to know the place.
